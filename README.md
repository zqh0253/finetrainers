# finetrainers 🧪

Finetrainers is a work-in-progress library to support (accessible) training of diffusion models. Our first priority is to support LoRA training for all popular video models in [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers), and eventually other methods like controlnets, control-loras, distillation, etc.

## Quickstart

Clone the repository and make sure the requirements are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt` and install `diffusers` from source by `pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers`. The requirements specify `diffusers>=0.32.1`, but it is always recommended to use the `main` branch of Diffusers for the latest features and bugfixes. Note that the `main` branch for `finetrainers` is also the development branch, and stable support should be expected from the release tags.

Checkout to the latest release tag:

```bash
git fetch --all --tags
git checkout tags/v0.0.1
```

Follow the instructions mentioned in the [README](https://github.com/a-r-r-o-w/finetrainers/tree/v0.0.1) for the latest stable release.

#### Using the main branch

To get started quickly with example training scripts on the main development branch, refer to the following:
- [LTX-Video Pika Effects Crush](./examples/training/sft/ltx_video/crush_smol_lora/)
- [CogVideoX Pika Effects Crush](./examples/training/sft/cogvideox/crush_smol_lora/)
- [Wan T2V Pika Effects Crush](./examples/training/sft/wan/crush_smol_lora/)

The following are some simple datasets/HF orgs with good datasets to test training with quickly:
- [Disney Video Generation Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Wild-Heart/Disney-VideoGeneration-Dataset)
- [bigdatapw Video Dataset Collection](https://huggingface.co/bigdata-pw)
- [Finetrainers HF Dataset Collection](https://huggingface.co/finetrainers)

Please checkout [`docs/models`](./docs/models/) and [`examples/training`](./examples/training/) to learn more about supported models for training & example reproducible training launch scripts.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> It is recommended to use Pytorch 2.5.1 or above for training. Previous versions can lead to completely black videos, OOM errors, or other issues and are not tested. For fully reproducible training, please use the same environment as mentioned in [environment.md](./docs/environment.md).

## News

- 🔥 **2025-03-07**: CogView4 support added!
- 🔥 **2025-03-03**: Wan T2V support added!
- 🔥 **2025-03-03**: We have shipped a complete refactor to support multi-backend distributed training, better precomputation handling for big datasets, model specification format (externally usable for training custom models), FSDP & more.
- 🔥 **2025-02-12**: We have shipped a set of tooling to curate small and high-quality video datasets for fine-tuning. See [video-dataset-scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/video-dataset-scripts) documentation page for details!
- 🔥 **2025-02-12**: Check out [eisneim/ltx_lora_training_i2v_t2v](https://github.com/eisneim/ltx_lora_training_i2v_t2v/)! It builds off of `finetrainers` to support image to video training for LTX-Video and STG guidance for inference.
- 🔥 **2025-01-15**: Support for naive FP8 weight-casting training added! This allows training HunyuanVideo in under 24 GB upto specific resolutions.
- 🔥 **2025-01-13**: Support for T2V full-finetuning added! Thanks to [@ArEnSc](https://github.com/ArEnSc) for taking up the initiative!
- 🔥 **2025-01-03**: Support for T2V LoRA finetuning of [CogVideoX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/api/pipelines/cogvideox) added!
- 🔥 **2024-12-20**: Support for T2V LoRA finetuning of [Hunyuan Video](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/api/pipelines/hunyuan_video) added! We would like to thank @SHYuanBest for his work on a training script [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/10254).
- 🔥 **2024-12-18**: Support for T2V LoRA finetuning of [LTX Video](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/api/pipelines/ltx_video) added!

## Support Matrix

> [!NOTE]
> The following numbers were obtained from the [release branch](https://github.com/a-r-r-o-w/finetrainers/tree/v0.0.1). The `main` branch is unstable at the moment and may use higher memory.
